A beverage-can stove, or pop-can stove, is a do it yourself, ultralight, alcohol-burning portable stove. The simple design is made entirely from aluminium cans, lending itself to countless variations.

Total weight, including a windscreen/stand, can be less than one ounce (28 g). The design is popular in ultralight backpacking due to its low cost and lighter weight than commercial stoves. This advantage may be lost on long hiking trips, where a lot of fuel is packed, since alcohol has less energy per weight than some other stove fuels.

Of the available fuels, methanol delivers the least energy, isopropanol delivers more, butanol is hardly ever used, and pure ethanol the most.[1] Denatured alcohol can contain various mixtures of ethanol, other alcohols, and other chemicals. All but isopropanol burn with a smokeless flame; it can provide both light and heat.
