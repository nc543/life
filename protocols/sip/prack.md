RFC 3262: Reliability of Provisional Responses in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)

Reliability of Provisional Responses in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)

SIP 定義兩種 responses -- provisional response 和 final responses。
   Final responses convey 請求處理的結果, and are
   sent reliably.  Provisional responses 提供provide information on the
   progress of the request processing, but are not sent reliably in RFC
   3261.

   It was later observed that reliability was important in several
   cases, including interoperability scenarios with the PSTN.
   Therefore, an optional capability was needed to support reliable
   transmission of provisional responses.  That capability is provided
   in this specification.
